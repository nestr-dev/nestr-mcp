Nestr is a work management platform for teams practicing self-organization, Holacracy, Sociocracy, and Teal methodologies.

## Workspace Types

Most workspaces are organizational, representing a self-organized team. Check the workspace's labels to determine the type:

- **Organizational Workspace** (most common): Has the "anchor-circle" label. The workspace IS the anchor circle of a self-organized team using Holacracy/Sociocracy/Teal governance. Contains sub-circles, roles with accountabilities and domains, and collaborative projects.
- **Personal Workspace**: No "anchor-circle" label. A personal space where an individual tracks their own work and projects.

The specific self-organization methodology is stored in \`workspace.data['self_organisation_type']\` (e.g., "holacracy", "sociocracy", "custom").

## Core Concepts

- **Workspace**: Top-level container - either an organization's anchor circle or a personal workspace
- **Nest**: The universal building block - can be a task, project, role, circle, meeting, or any work item
- **Circle**: A self-governing team with defined purpose, roles, and accountabilities (Holacracy/Sociocracy concept)
- **Role**: A set of responsibilities (accountabilities) and decision rights (domains) that a person energizes
- **Label**: Tags that define what type of nest something is (e.g., "project", "todo", "meeting", "anchor-circle")

## Best Practices

1. **Start by listing workspaces** to get the workspace ID and check if it has the "anchor-circle" label
2. **Use search** to find specific items rather than browsing through hierarchies
3. **Check labels** to understand what type of nest you're working with
4. **Use @mentions** in comments to notify team members
5. **Respect the hierarchy**: nests live under parents (workspace → circle → role/project → task)

## Important Labels

Labels define what type a nest is. The API strips the "circleplus-" prefix, so use labels without it.

**Governance Structure:**
- \`anchor-circle\` - The workspace itself when it's an organization
- \`circle\` - A sub-circle/team within the organization
- \`role\` - A role with accountabilities and domains
- \`accountability\` - An ongoing activity the role is responsible for performing (Holacracy: "an ongoing activity that the Role will enact")
- \`domain\` - An area the role has exclusive control over; others must get permission to impact it (Holacracy: "something the Role may exclusively control on behalf of the Organization")
- \`policy\` - A grant or restriction of authority affecting how others interact with a domain or process. Can live on a domain, role, or circle directly.

**Note:** Accountabilities, domains, and policies are child-nests of roles/circles. Use \`nestr_get_circle_roles\` or \`nestr_get_nest_children\` to retrieve them. The generic \`nestr_search\` won't return them by default.

**Meetings & Operations:**
- \`metric\` - A metric tracked by a role/circle
- \`checklist\` - A recurring checklist item
- \`governance\` - A governance meeting
- \`tactical\` - A tactical/operational meeting

**OKRs & Goals:**
- \`goal\` - An Objective (the O in OKR)
- \`result\` - A Key Result (the KR in OKR)

**General:**
- \`project\` - A project with status tracking (Current/Waiting/Done/Future)
- \`note\` - A simple note
- \`meeting\` - A calendar meeting
- \`prepared-tension\` - A tension (gap between current and desired state). Used for meeting agenda items, async governance proposals, and general tension processing. Central to Holacracy practice.

## Common Workflows

- **Task Management**: Create nests with "todo" label, update status fields, add comments for updates
- **Project Tracking**: List projects, get children to see tasks, check insights for metrics
- **Team Structure**: List circles to see teams, get roles to understand accountabilities and domains
- **Finding Accountabilities/Domains**: Use \`nestr_get_circle_roles\` for a circle's roles with their accountabilities, or \`nestr_get_nest_children\` on a specific role
- **Search & Discovery**: Use search to find any item by title or content across the workspace
